/*A class that is declared with abstract keyword is known as abstract class.
 * Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and
 * showing only the functionality to the user. Abstraction can be
 * achieved in 2 ways: 1)Abstract class(0 to 100%) 2)Interface(100%).
 * Abstract method does not have body. Abstract classes are extended
 * and abstract methods are implemented.*/

//This is a simple example of abstract class and abstract method
