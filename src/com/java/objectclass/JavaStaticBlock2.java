/*Another Java Static Block example. Static block is used to
 * initialize static variable also. When code is ran, JVM performs
 * two operation viz. loading .class file into memory and then calling
 * main() method. When class file loaded into memory static method
 * is called.
 * Static method is called once only i.e during class file loading
 * into memory*/
